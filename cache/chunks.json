Grade B For adults aged 76 to 85 years: Selectively screen adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer, considering the patient’s overall health, prior screening history, and patient’s preferences. Grade C To whom does this recommendation apply? Adults 45 years and older who do not have signs or symptoms of colorectal cancer and who are at average risk for colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]). What’s new? The USPSTF expanded the recommended ages for colorectal cancer screening to 45 to 75 years (previously, it was 50 to 75 years). The USPSTF continues to recommend selectively screening adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer. How to implement this recommendation? Screen all adults aged 45 to 75 years for colorectal cancer. Several recommended screening tests are available. Clinicians and patients may consider a variety of factors in deciding which test may be best for each person. For example, the tests require different frequencies of screening, location of screening (home or office), methods of screening (stool-based or direct visualization), preprocedure bowel preparation, anesthesia or sedation during the test, and follow-up procedures for abnormal findings. Recommended screening strategies include: High-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (HSgFOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) every year Stool DNA-FIT every 1 to 3 years Computed tomography colonography every 5 years Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years + annual FIT Colonoscopy screening every 10 years Selectively screen adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer. Discuss together with patients the decision to screen, taking into consideration the patient’s overall health status (life expectancy, comorbid conditions), prior screening history, and preferences.

These strategies varied in the screening modality, the age at which to start and stop screening, and the frequency of screening. 12 , 13 The USPSTF focused on findings from models that assumed an elevated population risk of colorectal cancer. These models were thought to better capture the currently observed epidemiologic trend of increasing incidence in adults younger than 50 years, which is thought to reflect cohort effects, with younger birth cohorts at greater risk for colorectal cancer than older cohorts. 12 , 13 , 15 The USPSTF focused on estimated life-years gained (compared with no screening) as the primary measure of the benefit of screening. Given this elevated population risk assumption, as well as assuming 100% adherence, the USPSTF determined that beginning screening at age 45 years and continuing to the age of 75 years, for the following screening strategies, yielded a reasonable balance of benefits (life-years gained) and burdens or harms (number of colonoscopies): annual FIT, sDNA-FIT every 1 to 3 years, CT colonography or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with annual FIT ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). Modeling estimates that screening with sDNA-FIT annually results in additional colonoscopy burden compared with annual FIT screening (approximately 850 more subsequent follow-up and surveillance colonoscopies needed per 1000 adults screened with annual sDNA-FIT). 12 Screening with sDNA-FIT every 2 years is estimated to result in approximately 300 more subsequent follow-up and surveillance colonoscopies per 1000 adults screened compared with annual FIT. In modeling analyses, performing sDNA-FIT every 3 years or high-sensitivity gFOBT annually (also included in Figure 1 and Figure 2 ) did not provide an efficient balance of the estimated lifetime number of colonoscopies vs the estimated life-years gained, compared with other options for stool-based screening. However, sDNA-FIT every 3 years or high-sensitivity gFOBT annually is still estimated to provide a reasonable balance of benefit in life-years gained and harms compared with no screening. 12 Additionally, there is greater uncertainty in the model predictions for high-sensitivity gFOBT strategies, given the underlying uncertainty around the sensitivity and specificity of high-sensitivity gFOBT to detect adenomas and colorectal cancer. 9 , 12",

These models were thought to better capture the currently observed epidemiologic trend of increasing incidence in adults younger than 50 years, which is thought to reflect cohort effects, with younger birth cohorts at greater risk for colorectal cancer than older cohorts. 12 , 13 , 15 The USPSTF focused on estimated life-years gained (compared with no screening) as the primary measure of the benefit of screening. Given this elevated population risk assumption, as well as assuming 100% adherence, the USPSTF determined that beginning screening at age 45 years and continuing to the age of 75 years, for the following screening strategies, yielded a reasonable balance of benefits (life-years gained) and burdens or harms (number of colonoscopies): annual FIT, sDNA-FIT every 1 to 3 years, CT colonography or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with annual FIT ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). Modeling estimates that screening with sDNA-FIT annually results in additional colonoscopy burden compared with annual FIT screening (approximately 850 more subsequent follow-up and surveillance colonoscopies needed per 1000 adults screened with annual sDNA-FIT). 12 Screening with sDNA-FIT every 2 years is estimated to result in approximately 300 more subsequent follow-up and surveillance colonoscopies per 1000 adults screened compared with annual FIT. In modeling analyses, performing sDNA-FIT every 3 years or high-sensitivity gFOBT annually (also included in Figure 1 and Figure 2 ) did not provide an efficient balance of the estimated lifetime number of colonoscopies vs the estimated life-years gained, compared with other options for stool-based screening. However, sDNA-FIT every 3 years or high-sensitivity gFOBT annually is still estimated to provide a reasonable balance of benefit in life-years gained and harms compared with no screening. 12 Additionally, there is greater uncertainty in the model predictions for high-sensitivity gFOBT strategies, given the underlying uncertainty around the sensitivity and specificity of high-sensitivity gFOBT to detect adenomas and colorectal cancer. 9 , 12",

Many comments were received on the USPSTF’s new B recommendation to screen adults aged 45 to 49 years; some supported the new recommendation, others requested that screening begin at an even younger age, and still others disagreed with starting screening before age 50 years. The USPSTF appreciates the various perspectives that were shared. Although future research could further strengthen the USPSTF’s understanding about the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening in adults aged 45 to 49 years, based on the USPSTF’s assessment of the available empirical, modeling, and epidemiologic data, the USPSTF finds adequate evidence that screening this age group provides a moderate net benefit. Several comments requested that colonoscopy to follow up an abnormal noncolonoscopy screening test result be considered part of screening. The USPSTF recognizes that the benefits of screening can only be fully achieved when follow-up of abnormal screening test results is performed. The USPSTF added language to the Practice Considerations section to clarify this.",

Given this uncertainty, it is unclear whether high-sensitivity gFOBT can detect as many cases of advanced adenomas and colorectal cancer as other stool-based tests Harms from screening with gFOBT arise from colonoscopy to follow up abnormal gFOBT results Requires dietary restrictions and three stool samples Requires good adherence over multiple rounds of testing Does not require bowel preparation, anesthesia, or transportation to and from the screening examination (test is performed at home) Evidence from 1 large cohort study that screening with FIT reduces colorectal cancer mortality Certain types of FIT have improved accuracy compared with gFOBT and HSgFOBT (20 μg hemoglobin per gram of feces threshold was used in the CISNET modeling) Harms from screening with FIT arise from colonoscopy to follow up abnormal FIT results Can be done with a single stool sample Requires good adherence over multiple rounds of testing Does not require bowel preparation, anesthesia or sedation, or transportation to and from the screening examination (test is performed at home) sDNA-FIT Every 1 to 3 c y Improved sensitivity compared with FIT per 1-time application of screening test Specificity is lower than that of FIT, resulting in more false-positive results, more follow-up colonoscopies, and more associated adverse events per sDNA-FIT screening test compared with per FIT test Modeling suggests that screening every 3 y does not provide a favorable (ie, efficient) balance of benefits and harms compared with other stool-based screening options (ie, annual FIT or sDNA-FIT every 1 or 2 y) Insufficient evidence about appropriate longitudinal followup of abnormal findings after a negative follow-up colonoscopy",

Grade A For adults aged 45 to 49 years: Screen adults aged 45 to 49 years for colorectal cancer. Grade B For adults aged 76 to 85 years: Selectively screen adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer, considering the patient’s overall health, prior screening history, and patient’s preferences. Grade C To whom does this recommendation apply? Adults 45 years and older who do not have signs or symptoms of colorectal cancer and who are at average risk for colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]). What’s new? The USPSTF expanded the recommended ages for colorectal cancer screening to 45 to 75 years (previously, it was 50 to 75 years). The USPSTF continues to recommend selectively screening adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer. How to implement this recommendation? Screen all adults aged 45 to 75 years for colorectal cancer. Several recommended screening tests are available. Clinicians and patients may consider a variety of factors in deciding which test may be best for each person. For example, the tests require different frequencies of screening, location of screening (home or office), methods of screening (stool-based or direct visualization), preprocedure bowel preparation, anesthesia or sedation during the test, and follow-up procedures for abnormal findings. Recommended screening strategies include: High-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (HSgFOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) every year Stool DNA-FIT every 1 to 3 years Computed tomography colonography every 5 years Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years + annual FIT Colonoscopy screening every 10 years Selectively screen adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer. Discuss together with patients the decision to screen, taking into consideration the patient’s overall health status (life expectancy, comorbid conditions), prior screening history, and preferences. What are other relevant USPSTF recommendations? The USPSTF has a recommendation statement on aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer, available at www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org Where to read the full recommendation statement? Visit the USPSTF website to read the full recommendation statement.

What’s new? The USPSTF expanded the recommended ages for colorectal cancer screening to 45 to 75 years (previously, it was 50 to 75 years). The USPSTF continues to recommend selectively screening adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer. How to implement this recommendation? Screen all adults aged 45 to 75 years for colorectal cancer. Several recommended screening tests are available. Clinicians and patients may consider a variety of factors in deciding which test may be best for each person. For example, the tests require different frequencies of screening, location of screening (home or office), methods of screening (stool-based or direct visualization), preprocedure bowel preparation, anesthesia or sedation during the test, and follow-up procedures for abnormal findings. Recommended screening strategies include: High-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (HSgFOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) every year Stool DNA-FIT every 1 to 3 years Computed tomography colonography every 5 years Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years + annual FIT Colonoscopy screening every 10 years Selectively screen adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer. Discuss together with patients the decision to screen, taking into consideration the patient’s overall health status (life expectancy, comorbid conditions), prior screening history, and preferences. What are other relevant USPSTF recommendations? The USPSTF has a recommendation statement on aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer, available at www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org Where to read the full recommendation statement? Visit the USPSTF website to read the full recommendation statement. This includes more details on the rationale of the recommendation, including benefits and harms; supporting evidence; and recommendations of others.",

In 2016, the USPSTF recommended screening for colorectal cancer starting at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years (A recommendation). In addition, the USPSTF concluded that the decision to screen for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years should be an individual one, taking into account the patient’s overall health and prior screening history (C recommendation) and that screening should be discontinued after age 85 years.

These strategies varied in the screening modality, the age at which to start and stop screening, and the frequency of screening. 12 , 13 The USPSTF focused on findings from models that assumed an elevated population risk of colorectal cancer.

Many comments were received on the USPSTF’s new B recommendation to screen adults aged 45 to 49 years; some supported the new recommendation, others requested that screening begin at an even younger age, and still others disagreed with starting screening before age 50 years. The USPSTF appreciates the various perspectives that were shared. Although future research could further strengthen the USPSTF’s understanding about the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening in adults aged 45 to 49 years, based on the USPSTF’s assessment of the available empirical, modeling, and epidemiologic data, the USPSTF finds adequate evidence that screening this age group provides a moderate net benefit. Several comments requested that colonoscopy to follow up an abnormal noncolonoscopy screening test result be considered part of screening. The USPSTF recognizes that the benefits of screening can only be fully achieved when follow-up of abnormal screening test results is performed. The USPSTF added language to the Practice Considerations section to clarify this.",

    "augmented_chunk": "Adults 45–49 screening B recommendation; clarify colonoscopy follow‑up after abnormal tests\n\nA draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 27, 2020, to November 23, 2020. Many comments were received on the USPSTF’s new B recommendation to screen adults aged 45 to 49 years; some supported the new recommendation, others requested that screening begin at an even younger age, and still others disagreed with starting screening before age 50 years. The USPSTF appreciates the various perspectives that were shared. Although future research could further strengthen the USPSTF’s understanding about the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening in adults aged 45 to 49 years, based on the USPSTF’s assessment of the available empirical, modeling, and epidemiologic data, the USPSTF finds adequate evidence that screening this age group provides a moderate net benefit. Several comments requested that colonoscopy to follow up an abnormal noncolonoscopy screening test result be considered part of screening. The USPSTF recognizes that the benefits of screening can only be fully achieved when follow-up of abnormal screening test results is performed. The USPSTF added language to the Practice Considerations section to clarify this.",

Hodgkin lymphoma can be segregated into the following three age cohorts because of the variation in etiologies and histological subtypes (see Table 1 ): Children: More males than females are affected in the youngest age cohort, especially in children younger than 10 years. Individuals aged 14 years and younger have a higher prevalence of the non-classical nodular lymphocyte-predominant disease (NLPHL) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–associated mixed-cellularity disease. EBV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma increases in prevalence in association with larger family size and lower socioeconomic status.[ 4 ] Early exposure to common infections in early childhood appears to decrease the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, most likely by maturation of cellular immunity.[ 5 , 6 ] Adolescents and young adults: Hodgkin lymphoma in individuals aged 15 to 34 years is associated with a higher socioeconomic status in industrialized countries, increased sibship size, and earlier birth order.[ 7 ] The lower risk of Hodgkin lymphoma observed in young adults with multiple older, but not younger, siblings, is consistent with the hypothesis that early exposure to viral infection (which the siblings bring home from school, for example) may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.[ 5 ] Nodular-sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common subtype, followed by mixed cellularity. Older adults: Hodgkin lymphoma also occurs in individuals aged 55 to 74 years, who have a higher risk of lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma.

EBV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma increases in prevalence in association with larger family size and lower socioeconomic status.[ 4 ] Early exposure to common infections in early childhood appears to decrease the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, most likely by maturation of cellular immunity.[ 5 , 6 ] Adolescents and young adults: Hodgkin lymphoma in individuals aged 15 to 34 years is associated with a higher socioeconomic status in industrialized countries, increased sibship size, and earlier birth order.[ 7 ] The lower risk of Hodgkin lymphoma observed in young adults with multiple older, but not younger, siblings, is consistent with the hypothesis that early exposure to viral infection (which the siblings bring home from school, for example) may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.[ 5 ] Nodular-sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common subtype, followed by mixed cellularity. Older adults: Hodgkin lymphoma also occurs in individuals aged 55 to 74 years, who have a higher risk of lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment of older adults is not discussed in this summary. For more information, see Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment .",

The incidence of EBV tumor cell positivity for Hodgkin lymphoma in low-income countries ranges from 15% to 25% in adolescents and young adults.[ 16 - 18 ] A high incidence of mixed-cellularity histology in childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is seen in low-income countries, and these cases are generally EBV positive (approximately 80%).[ 19 ] EBV serologic status is not a prognostic factor for failure-free survival in young adult patients with Hodgkin lymphoma,[ 16 - 18 , 20 ] but plasma EBV DNA has been associated with an inferior outcome in adults.[ 21 ] However, children with intermediate-risk disease with higher levels of EBV DNA at diagnosis have better outcomes.[ 15 ] This also correlates with better outcomes for patients with mixed-cellularity disease treated with dose-dense chemotherapy (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide [ABVE-PC]). Patients with a previous history of serologically confirmed infectious mononucleosis have a fourfold increased risk of developing EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma. These patients are not at increased risk of developing EBV-negative Hodgkin lymphoma.[ 22 ] Individuals with immunodeficiency have an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma,[ 23 ] although the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is even higher. Characteristics of Hodgkin lymphoma presenting in the context of immunodeficiency are as follows: Hodgkin lymphoma usually occurs at a younger age and with histologies other than nodular sclerosing in patients with primary immunodeficiencies.[ 23 ] The risk of Hodgkin lymphoma increases as much as 50-fold over the general population in patients with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS).[ 24 ] Although it is not an AIDS-defining malignancy, the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma appears to be higher in HIV-infected individuals, including children.[ 25 , 26 ]",

The incidence of EBV tumor cell positivity for Hodgkin lymphoma in low-income countries ranges from 15% to 25% in adolescents and young adults.[ 16 - 18 ] A high incidence of mixed-cellularity histology in childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is seen in low-income countries, and these cases are generally EBV positive (approximately 80%).[ 19 ] EBV serologic status is not a prognostic factor for failure-free survival in young adult patients with Hodgkin lymphoma,[ 16 - 18 , 20 ] but plasma EBV DNA has been associated with an inferior outcome in adults.[ 21 ] However, children with intermediate-risk disease with higher levels of EBV DNA at diagnosis have better outcomes.[ 15 ] This also correlates with better outcomes for patients with mixed-cellularity disease treated with dose-dense chemotherapy (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide [ABVE-PC]). Patients with a previous history of serologically confirmed infectious mononucleosis have a fourfold increased risk of developing EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma. These patients are not at increased risk of developing EBV-negative Hodgkin lymphoma.[ 22 ] Individuals with immunodeficiency have an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma,[ 23 ] although the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is even higher. Characteristics of Hodgkin lymphoma presenting in the context of immunodeficiency are as follows: Hodgkin lymphoma usually occurs at a younger age and with histologies other than nodular sclerosing in patients with primary immunodeficiencies.[ 23 ] The risk of Hodgkin lymphoma increases as much as 50-fold over the general population in patients with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS).[ 24 ] Although it is not an AIDS-defining malignancy, the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma appears to be higher in HIV-infected individuals, including children.[ 25 , 26 ]",

    "raw_chunk": "Defining strict CT or MRI size criteria for lymphomatous nodal involvement is complicated by several factors, such as size overlap between what proves to be benign reactive hyperplasia versus malignant lymphadenopathy, the implication of nodal clusters, and obliquity of node orientation to the scan plane. Additional difficulties more specific to children include greater variability of normal nodal size and the frequent occurrence of reactive hyperplasia. General concepts to consider for defining lymphomatous involvement by CT or MRI include the following: Contiguous nodal clustering or matting is highly suggestive of lymphomatous involvement. Any focal mass lesion large enough to characterize in a visceral organ is considered lymphomatous involvement unless the imaging characteristics indicate an alternative etiology. Criteria for nodal involvement may vary by cooperative group or protocol.[ 4 ] Children's Oncology Group (COG) and EuroNet protocols consider lymph nodes abnormal if the long axis is greater than 2 cm, regardless of the short axis and PET avidity. Lymph nodes with a long axis measuring between 1 cm and 2 cm are only considered abnormal if they are part of a conglomerate of nodes and are fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET positive. In the Gesellschaft für Pädiatrische Onkologie und Hämatologie (GPOH) GPOH-HD-2002 study, nodal involvement was defined as node size greater than 2 cm in largest diameter. The node was not involved if it was less than 1 cm and was considered questionable if it was between 1 cm and 2 cm. The decision on involvement was then made based on additional clinical evidence.[ 7 ] In an analysis of 47,828 imaging measurements from 2,983 adult and pediatric patients with lymphoma enrolled in ten multicenter clinical trials, a single dimension measurement of 15 mm or more constituted involvement.[ 8 ]",

    "augmented_chunk": "Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma CT/MRI nodal-involvement criteria: matting, visceral mass, and ≥15 mm single-dimension threshold\n\nDefining strict CT or MRI size criteria for lymphomatous nodal involvement is complicated by several factors, such as size overlap between what proves to be benign reactive hyperplasia versus malignant lymphadenopathy, the implication of nodal clusters, and obliquity of node orientation to the scan plane. Additional difficulties more specific to children include greater variability of normal nodal size and the frequent occurrence of reactive hyperplasia. General concepts to consider for defining lymphomatous involvement by CT or MRI include the following: Contiguous nodal clustering or matting is highly suggestive of lymphomatous involvement. Any focal mass lesion large enough to characterize in a visceral organ is considered lymphomatous involvement unless the imaging characteristics indicate an alternative etiology. Criteria for nodal involvement may vary by cooperative group or protocol.[ 4 ] Children's Oncology Group (COG) and EuroNet protocols consider lymph nodes abnormal if the long axis is greater than 2 cm, regardless of the short axis and PET avidity. Lymph nodes with a long axis measuring between 1 cm and 2 cm are only considered abnormal if they are part of a conglomerate of nodes and are fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET positive. In the Gesellschaft für Pädiatrische Onkologie und Hämatologie (GPOH) GPOH-HD-2002 study, nodal involvement was defined as node size greater than 2 cm in largest diameter. The node was not involved if it was less than 1 cm and was considered questionable if it was between 1 cm and 2 cm. The decision on involvement was then made based on additional clinical evidence.[ 7 ] In an analysis of 47,828 imaging measurements from 2,983 adult and pediatric patients with lymphoma enrolled in ten multicenter clinical trials, a single dimension measurement of 15 mm or more constituted involvement.[ 8 ]",

Since preoperative treatment may affect the ability to obtain an accurate tissue diagnosis, a diagnostic biopsy should be obtained as soon as the risks associated with general anesthesia or heavy sedation are alleviated.

Clinical trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website .

The study evaluated six cycles of doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD) with either brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab (see Table 6 ). A total of 970 enrolled patients with newly diagnosed stage III or stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma were randomly assigned to receive either brentuximab vedotin-AVD or nivolumab-AVD. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was required for patients who received brentuximab vedotin-AVD and optional for patients who received nivolumab-AVD. The cardioprotectant dexrazoxane was allowed for all patients, per the investigator's choice. Radiation therapy for pediatric patients was based on the end-of-treatment imaging evaluation after completion of six cycles of systemic therapy. The use of the AVD backbone with either agent was to reduce or avoid radiation therapy and reduce the use of alkylating agents.[ 30 ] Patients aged 12 to 17 years accounted for approximately 24% of the study's total accrual. About 63% of patients had stage IV disease, 68% had B symptoms, and 29% had bulky disease. There were no differences between the brentuximab-AVD group and the nivolumab-AVD group. Results for this study were released early at a planned interim analysis because the primary PFS end point crossed the protocol-specified monitoring boundary. However, patients continued to be monitored until a median of 2 years was achieved. The 2-year PFS rate favored nivolumab-AVD over brentuximab vedotin-AVD (92% vs. 83%, respectively) after a median follow-up of 2.1 years. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.30–0.65). Less than 1% of patients (n = 7) in either arm received consolidative radiation therapy. The nivolumab-AVD regimen was tolerated better than the brentuximab-AVD regimen. In this study, 9.4% of patients discontinued nivolumab, while 22.2% of patients discontinued brentuximab. Neuropathy was more frequent in the brentuximab arm. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were more common in the nivolumab arm (7% and 3%, respectively), but other autoimmune conditions were not seen more frequently in the nivolumab arm. Three age groups were analyzed (12–17 years, 18–60 years, and >60 years). In all age groups, the 2-year PFS rates were significantly increased with the nivolumab-AVD regimen compared with the brentuximab-AVD regimen. Aged 12–17 years: 95% versus 83%. Aged 18–60 years: 92% versus 86%. Aged older than 60 years: 88% versus 65%. The authors suggested that nivolumab-AVD will likely be a new standard therapy for patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma.",

In late-health outcome studies of pediatric cancer survivors, the risk of anthracycline cardiomyopathy has been shown to exponentially increase after exposure to cumulative anthracycline doses of 250 to 300 mg/m 2 .[ 82 , 83 ] Subsequent need for mediastinal radiation can further enhance the risk of several late cardiac events.[ 84 ] In an effort to optimize disease control and preserve both cardiac and gonadal function, pediatric regimens for low-risk disease most often feature a restricted number of cycles of ABVD derivative combinations. For those with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease, alkylating agents and etoposide are integrated into anthracycline-containing regimens.

In patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease, the standard of care in adult oncology practices typically involves at least six cycles of ABVD chemotherapy that delivers a cumulative anthracycline dose of 300 mg/m 2 .[ 80 , 81 ] For more information, see Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment . In late-health outcome studies of pediatric cancer survivors, the risk of anthracycline cardiomyopathy has been shown to exponentially increase after exposure to cumulative anthracycline doses of 250 to 300 mg/m 2 .[ 82 , 83 ] Subsequent need for mediastinal radiation can further enhance the risk of several late cardiac events.[ 84 ] In an effort to optimize disease control and preserve both cardiac and gonadal function, pediatric regimens for low-risk disease most often feature a restricted number of cycles of ABVD derivative combinations. For those with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease, alkylating agents and etoposide are integrated into anthracycline-containing regimens. No prospective studies of efficacy or toxicity in adolescent or young adults treated with pediatric versus adult regimens have been reported; however, some secondary analyses have been conducted.[ 85 ]",

Limitations of this study include differences in the study populations. More adolescents and young adults aged 17 to 22 years in the E2496 study had stage III or IV disease and B symptoms, whereas more adolescents and young adults aged 17 to 22 years in the AHOD0031 study had bulky disease and received radiation (although with smaller doses than those in E2496). Some of these differences were addressed using a propensity score analysis that confirmed inferior FFS for adolescents and young adults in the E2496 trial than those in the AHOD0031 trial. The study was also not a prospective randomized trial. The 5-year failure-free survival (FFS) rates were 68% for patients in the ECOG trial and 81% for patients in the COG trial, with OS rates of 89% and 97%, respectively.",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications for brentuximab vedotin in adult patients are as follows: (1) classical Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of autologous HSCT or after failure of at least two previous multiagent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not autologous HSCT candidates, and (2) classical Hodgkin lymphoma at high risk of relapse or progression, as postautologous HSCT consolidation therapy. For more information, see the Treatment of Recurrent Classic HL section in Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment. A phase II trial in 102 adults with Hodgkin lymphoma whose disease relapsed after autologous HSCT showed the following:[ 21 - 24 ] A complete remission rate of 34% and a partial remission rate of 40% was observed.[ 21 - 23 ] Patients who achieved a complete remission (n = 34) had a 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 58% and a 3-year overall survival (OS) rate of 73%, with only 6 of 34 patients proceeding to allogeneic HSCT while in remission. Further follow-up demonstrated a 5-year OS rate of 41% and a PFS rate of 22%. However, patients who achieved a complete remission (38%) had a 5-year OS rate of 64% and a PFS rate of 52%.[ 24 ][ Level of evidence B4 ] The number of pediatric patients treated with brentuximab vedotin is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently than adult patients.

Twenty-four of 42 patients (57%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41%–72%) treated at this dose level experienced a complete response within the first four cycles.

Compared with alternate second-line regimens, brentuximab vedotin with gemcitabine offers the advantage of avoiding agents, such as anthracyclines, alkylators, or epipodophyllotoxins, that are associated with late treatment-related sequelae. Several small retrospective studies have evaluated the outcomes of pediatric and young adult patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma treated with brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine.

All patients were given two cycles of reinduction therapy consisting of ifosfamide, etoposide, prednisolone (IEP) and adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD), followed by consolidation with either radiation therapy alone in patients with low-risk disease or high-dose chemotherapy (HDC)/autologous HSCT, with or without radiation therapy for patients with high-risk disease. There were three risk groups:[ 42 ] R1: Patients with relapse longer than 12 months after completion of initial therapy, who had early-stage disease and received two cycles of chemotherapy. R3: Patients with progression during or up to 3 months after completion of initial therapy. R2: Patients with all other relapses. Patients in the R1 subgroup were defined as low risk, were not studied with 18F-FDG PET, and proceeded to radiation therapy. Patients in the R3 subgroup were defined as high risk and all received HDC/HSCT. Patients in the R2 subgroup were defined as low or high risk based on 18F-FDG PET response. If the PET scan was negative with 50% tumor-volume reduction, the patient was defined as low risk and proceeded to radiation therapy. Those with an inadequate 18F-FDG PET response (Deauville score >3) received HDC/HSCT with radiation therapy. For all 118 patients, the 5-year PFS rate was 71.3%, and the OS rate was 82.7%. For the 41 patients in the low-risk group, the PFS rate was 89.7%, and the OS rate was 97.4%.

In this cohort, the cumulative incidence of nonsurgical premature menopause among survivors treated with alkylating agents and abdominal or pelvic radiation approached 30%.[ 15 , 16 ] These patients were treated before 1986, usually with substantially higher doses of alkylating agents than are used in current regimens in the Children's Oncology Group (COG), EuroNet, or other consortiums. A German study demonstrated that parenthood for female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma was similar to that of the general population, although parenthood was lower for survivors who received pelvic radiation therapy.[ 20 ] For more information, see the Ovary section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer. Thyroid Abnormalities Abnormalities of the thyroid gland, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroid neoplasms, occur at a higher rate among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma than in the general population.",

Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Children and Adolescents With Hodgkin Lymphoma Added Herrera et al. as reference 30 . Added text to state that in the group of patients who received the novel agent brentuximab vedotin in the Children's Oncology Group AHOD1331 trial, health-related quality of life improved over the course of initial therapy, earlier, and to a greater extent (cited Williams et al. as reference 73). Revised text about the S1826 phase III study, including the clinical presentation, follow-up, side effects, and outcomes of the patients who received doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD) with either brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab. Revised Table 9 to update the number of patients and outcome results for those who received the nivolumab-AVD regimen. Added AHOD2131 as a new clinical trial that is currently being conducted for patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment of Primary Refractory or Recurrent Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children and Adolescents Added text about the results of a study that included 28 patients aged 5 to 30 years with low-risk relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma who were treated with four cycles of nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin.

In addition, multiple unrelated families harbored novel loss of function variants in POLR1E and stop-gain variants in IRF7 and EEF2KMT . These findings validated previous studies and identified additional germline pathogenic variants associated with an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma.",

EBV DNA found in cell-free blood 8 days after the initiation of therapy predicted an inferior event-free survival (EFS).[ 15 ] The incidence of EBV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma also shows the following distinct epidemiological features: Histology. EBV positivity is most commonly observed in tumors with mixed-cellularity histology and is almost never seen in patients with lymphocyte-predominant histology (i.e., NLPHL).[ 16 , 17 ]",

For patients treated with chemotherapy alone, PET scanning is ideally performed a minimum of 3 weeks after the completion of therapy, while patients whose last treatment modality was radiation therapy should not undergo PET scanning until 8 to 12 weeks postradiation.[ 35 ] For patients treated with chemotherapy alone, PET scanning is ideally performed a minimum of 3 weeks after the completion of therapy, while patients whose last treatment modality was radiation therapy should not undergo PET scanning until 8 to 12 weeks postradiation.[ 35 ]",

ABVD-related sequelae include a dose-related risk of cardiopulmonary toxicity related to doxorubicin and bleomycin.[ 11 - 13 ] The cumulative dose of these agents has been proactively restricted in pediatric patients to reduce this risk. In an effort to reduce chemotherapy-related toxicity, hybrid regimens alternating MOPP and ABVD or derivative therapy were developed. They use lower total cumulative doses of alkylators, doxorubicin, and bleomycin.[ 14 , 15 ] With the use of a cardioprotectant and replacing bleomycin with other agents, ABVD-based regimens are being used more in pediatric patients.[ 16 ] MOPP-related sequelae include a dose-related risk of infertility and subsequent myelodysplasia and leukemia.[ 2 , 9 ] The use of MOPP-derivative regimens substituting less leukemogenic and gonadotoxic alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide) for mechlorethamine or restricting cumulative alkylating agent dose exposure reduces this risk.[ 10 ] However, COPP-based regimens (substituting cyclophosphamide for mechlorethamine) are not commonly used in contemporary treatment protocols because of the restricted availability of procarbazine in many parts of the world.",

ISRT, used in contemporary COG trials, is used when optimal prechemotherapy imaging (PET-CT in a position similar to the position to be used at the time of radiation therapy) is not available to the radiation oncologist. Because the delineation of the area of involvement is less precise, a somewhat larger treatment volume is contoured than for INRT, typically at least 2 cm around the nodes where the lymphoma was located before chemotherapy was given. The exact volume will depend on the individual case scenario.[ 45 ] There are several situations in which this definition is further modified, such as when inappropriately large volumes of sensitive normal tissues might be exposed.[ 50 ] Modified involved-field radiation therapy is the term used in the EuroNet-PHL-C1 trial to describe treatment volumes that contain the involved lymph node(s) as seen before chemotherapy plus radiation planning margins of 1 cm to 2 cm, depending on the area of involvement. These volumes are comparable to ISRT fields, although the development preceded the widespread availability of CT-based planning. Breast-sparing radiation therapy plans using proton therapy are under evaluation to determine whether there is a statistically significant reduction in dose.[ 51 ] Ongoing studies seek to determine whether doses to other critical organs, such as the heart and lungs, can be reduced with proton therapy, without compromising survival outcomes.[ 52 ][ Level of evidence C1 ] Long-term results are pending.",

A total of 970 enrolled patients with newly diagnosed stage III or stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma were randomly assigned to receive either brentuximab vedotin-AVD or nivolumab-AVD. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was required for patients who received brentuximab vedotin-AVD and optional for patients who received nivolumab-AVD. The cardioprotectant dexrazoxane was allowed for all patients, per the investigator's choice. Radiation therapy for pediatric patients was based on the end-of-treatment imaging evaluation after completion of six cycles of systemic therapy. The use of the AVD backbone with either agent was to reduce or avoid radiation therapy and reduce the use of alkylating agents.[ 30 ] Patients aged 12 to 17 years accounted for approximately 24% of the study's total accrual. About 63% of patients had stage IV disease, 68% had B symptoms, and 29% had bulky disease. There were no differences between the brentuximab-AVD group and the nivolumab-AVD group. Results for this study were released early at a planned interim analysis because the primary PFS end point crossed the protocol-specified monitoring boundary. However, patients continued to be monitored until a median of 2 years was achieved. The 2-year PFS rate favored nivolumab-AVD over brentuximab vedotin-AVD (92% vs. 83%, respectively) after a median follow-up of 2.1 years. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.30–0.65). Less than 1% of patients (n = 7) in either arm received consolidative radiation therapy. The nivolumab-AVD regimen was tolerated better than the brentuximab-AVD regimen. In this study, 9.4% of patients discontinued nivolumab, while 22.2% of patients discontinued brentuximab. Neuropathy was more frequent in the brentuximab arm. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were more common in the nivolumab arm (7% and 3%, respectively), but other autoimmune conditions were not seen more frequently in the nivolumab arm. Three age groups were analyzed (12–17 years, 18–60 years, and >60 years).

Older patients with non-mixed cellularity histology experienced a significantly increased risk of having an event, compared with younger patients with the same histology (HR, 1.32). Older patients with mixed cellularity had significantly worse unadjusted 5-year EFS rates (77%) than younger patients (94%) (HR, 2.93 unadjusted). This result remained significant after multivariable modeling (HR, 3.72). The optimal approach for adolescents and young adults with Hodgkin lymphoma is complicated by critical but understudied variables. Factors such as tumor biology, disease control, supportive care needs, and long-term toxicities in adolescents and young adults with Hodgkin lymphoma require further research. Adolescent and young adult patients with Hodgkin lymphoma should consider participating in a clinical trial. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website .

A posttreatment semen analysis included 45 men at the 40-month follow-up. COPP appeared to be more gonadotoxic (19 of 23 men were azoospermic) than COPDAC (0 of 22 men were azoospermic). Biomarker analyses that included follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and inhibin B also suggested higher prevalence of gonadotoxicity after COPP than COPDAC. Similarly, based on biomarker analyses limited to 113 women, FSH was significantly increased in 55 women who were randomly assigned to receive COPP, compared with 58 women who were randomly assigned to receive COPDAC. Another EuroNet-PHL-C1 trial investigated whether radiation therapy can be omitted in patients with adequate morphological and metabolic responses to OEPA.[ 77 ] Among 738 patients with early-stage disease (median follow-up period, 63.3 months), 714 patients were assigned to and received therapy in treatment group 1.

In a subgroup analysis (unplanned), the 5-year EFS rate among those with adequate early response to OEPA was 91.9% (95% CI, 88.1%–95.9%) with COPP and 82.9% (77.2%–89.0%) with COPDAC, but there was no difference in OS. A posttreatment semen analysis included 45 men at the 40-month follow-up. COPP appeared to be more gonadotoxic (19 of 23 men were azoospermic) than COPDAC (0 of 22 men were azoospermic). Biomarker analyses that included follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and inhibin B also suggested higher prevalence of gonadotoxicity after COPP than COPDAC. Similarly, based on biomarker analyses limited to 113 women, FSH was significantly increased in 55 women who were randomly assigned to receive COPP, compared with 58 women who were randomly assigned to receive COPDAC. Another EuroNet-PHL-C1 trial investigated whether radiation therapy can be omitted in patients with adequate morphological and metabolic responses to OEPA.[ 77 ] Among 738 patients with early-stage disease (median follow-up period, 63.3 months), 714 patients were assigned to and received therapy in treatment group 1. Among the 713 patients in the intention-to-treat group, 440 had adequate responses to two cycles of OEPA and did not receive radiation therapy. The 5-year EFS rate was 86.5% (95% CI, 83.3%–89.8%). The 5-year EFS rate was 88.6% (95% CI, 84.8%–92.5%) for the 273 patients with adequate responses to chemotherapy who also received radiation therapy. The study findings suggested that radiation therapy can be omitted in patients with early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have had adequate responses to OEPA chemotherapy.",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications for brentuximab vedotin in adult patients are as follows: (1) classical Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of autologous HSCT or after failure of at least two previous multiagent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not autologous HSCT candidates, and (2) classical Hodgkin lymphoma at high risk of relapse or progression, as postautologous HSCT consolidation therapy. For more information, see the Treatment of Recurrent Classic HL section in Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment. A phase II trial in 102 adults with Hodgkin lymphoma whose disease relapsed after autologous HSCT showed the following:[ 21 - 24 ] A complete remission rate of 34% and a partial remission rate of 40% was observed.[ 21 - 23 ] Patients who achieved a complete remission (n = 34) had a 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 58% and a 3-year overall survival (OS) rate of 73%, with only 6 of 34 patients proceeding to allogeneic HSCT while in remission. Further follow-up demonstrated a 5-year OS rate of 41% and a PFS rate of 22%. However, patients who achieved a complete remission (38%) had a 5-year OS rate of 64% and a PFS rate of 52%.[ 24 ][ Level of evidence B4 ] A complete remission rate of 34% and a partial remission rate of 40% was observed.[ 21 - 23 ] Patients who achieved a complete remission (n = 34) had a 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 58% and a 3-year overall survival (OS) rate of 73%, with only 6 of 34 patients proceeding to allogeneic HSCT while in remission.",

All patients were given two cycles of reinduction therapy consisting of ifosfamide, etoposide, prednisolone (IEP) and adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD), followed by consolidation with either radiation therapy alone in patients with low-risk disease or high-dose chemotherapy (HDC)/autologous HSCT, with or without radiation therapy for patients with high-risk disease. There were three risk groups:[ 42 ] R1: Patients with relapse longer than 12 months after completion of initial therapy, who had early-stage disease and received two cycles of chemotherapy. R3: Patients with progression during or up to 3 months after completion of initial therapy. R2: Patients with all other relapses. Patients in the R1 subgroup were defined as low risk, were not studied with 18F-FDG PET, and proceeded to radiation therapy. Patients in the R3 subgroup were defined as high risk and all received HDC/HSCT. Patients in the R2 subgroup were defined as low or high risk based on 18F-FDG PET response. If the PET scan was negative with 50% tumor-volume reduction, the patient was defined as low risk and proceeded to radiation therapy. Those with an inadequate 18F-FDG PET response (Deauville score >3) received HDC/HSCT with radiation therapy. For all 118 patients, the 5-year PFS rate was 71.3%, and the OS rate was 82.7%.

Shared decision-making is recommended for planning breast cancer surveillance.[ 79 ]",

Revised text about the S1826 phase III study, including the clinical presentation, follow-up, side effects, and outcomes of the patients who received doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD) with either brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab. Revised Table 9 to update the number of patients and outcome results for those who received the nivolumab-AVD regimen. Added AHOD2131 as a new clinical trial that is currently being conducted for patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment of Primary Refractory or Recurrent Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children and Adolescents Added text about the results of a study that included 28 patients aged 5 to 30 years with low-risk relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma who were treated with four cycles of nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin.

Shared decision-making is recommended for planning breast cancer surveillance.[ 79 ] Hereditary syndromes, other than high-risk breast cancer syndromes, and pathogenic variants may modify the effect of radiation exposure on breast cancer risk after childhood cancer.[ 80 , 81 ] A study of women survivors who received chest radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma showed that one of the most important factors in obtaining breast cancer screenings per guidelines was recommendation from their treating physician.[ 82 ] Standard guidelines for routine breast screening are available.

Neuropathic. Nociceptive pain, which may be either somatic or visceral in nature, originates with a chemical, mechanical, or thermal injury to tissue that stimulates pain receptors, which transmit a signal to the central nervous system (CNS), causing the perception of pain. Pain receptors are found in somatic (e.g., cutaneous, bone) and visceral tissues. The amount of visceral sensory innervation and the diffusion of visceral pain signals within the brain explain the difficulty experienced by patients in describing or localizing visceral pain compared with somatic pain. A specific type of visceral pain is referred pain, which is explained by the commingling of nerve fibers from somatic and visceral nociceptors at the level of the spinal cord. Patients mistakenly interpret the pain as originating from the innervated somatic tissue. Visceral pain may be accompanied by autonomic signs such as sweating, pallor, or bradycardia. Somatic pain is more easily localized. Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system or the CNS (spinal cord or brain). Causes of neuropathic pain of particular relevance to cancer include chemotherapy (e.g., vinca alkaloids), infiltration of the nerve roots by tumor, or damage to nerve roots (radiculopathy) or groups of nerve roots (plexopathy) due to tumor masses or treatment complications (e.g., radiation plexopathy).[ 8 ] The pain may be evoked by stimuli or spontaneous.

Pain intensity scales can also be used to develop a personalized pain goal (PPG).[ 4 ] A PPG is a patient’s self-reported pain management goal on a scale of 0 to 10 and is used to identify the maximum pain intensity that the patient considers tolerable.[ 5 ] The PPG is a relatively simple tool with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 77% when used for measuring pain relief.[ 6 ]",

There is no standard recommendation for the diagnosis and treatment of OIH. A trial of incremental opioid dose reductions may lead to an improvement in pain from OIH. However, this may be psychologically distressing to oncology patients who require opioid treatment. Opioid rotation is a strategy frequently employed if opioid tolerance has occurred. Methadone is an ideal opioid to switch to, given its mechanism of action as an opioid receptor agonist and NMDA receptor antagonist. Given the similarities between OIH and neuropathic pain, the addition of an adjunctive medication such as pregabalin has been recommended.[ 42 ] Opioid-induced respiratory depression may be caused by a blunting of the chemoreceptive response to carbon dioxide and oxygen levels and altered mechanical function of the lungs necessary for efficient ventilation and gas exchange.[ 57 ] Opioid-induced respiratory depression may manifest through decreased respiratory rate, hypoxemia, or increases in total exhaled carbon dioxide.[ 58 ] The prevalence of respiratory depression is not known but rarely occurs with proper opioid use and titration.[ 59 - 62 ] The following factors contribute to opioid-induced respiratory depression: Obstructive sleep apnea. Obesity. Concomitant sedating medications.",

In the United States, prescription of these agents requires enrollment in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program. Given the complexities related to methadone administration, it is important that this opioid be prescribed by experienced clinicians who can provide careful monitoring.

This randomized phase II trial demonstrated improved pain at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, without differences in treatment-related toxicity and with no increase with re-treatment rates that had been seen in previous single-fraction studies, done largely with 8 Gy. Patients who received the higher-dose SBRT had improved 1- and 2-year survival rates. The authors concluded that the higher dose of single-fraction SBRT is safe and suggested that this could become the standard of care, if confirmed in phase III studies.[ 24 ][ Level of evidence: I ]",

    "raw_chunk": "Frequently Asked Questions What is the Task Force recommending? The Task Force recommends that all women get screened for breast cancer every other year, starting at age 40 and continuing through age 74, to reduce their risk of dying from this disease. This is a B grade . In this final recommendation statement, we are also urgently calling for more research that will allow us to build on our existing guidance and help all women live longer and healthier lives. Specifically, we need to know how best to address health disparities across screening and treatment experienced by Black, Hispanic, Latina, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, and Alaska Native women. We also need studies on what more should be done for women with dense breasts, and we need evidence on the benefits and harms of screening in older women. These are I statements . How is this different from your previous final recommendation? While we have consistently recognized the value of mammography, the latest science makes it clear that we can save even more lives from breast cancer. Previously, we recommended that women in their 40s make an individual decision with their clinician on when they should start screening, taking into account their health history, preferences, and how they value the different potential benefits and harms. The Task Force now recommends that all women start getting screened for breast cancer every other year starting at age 40. Basically, it’s a shift from recommending women start screening between the ages of 40 and 50 to recommending that all women start getting screened when they turn 40. Is there specific guidance for women with dense breasts? Nearly half of all women have dense breasts, which increases their risk for breast cancer and means that mammograms may not work as well for them. Women are generally told that they have dense breasts after they’ve had a mammogram. These women deserve to know whether and how additional screening might help them stay healthy. Unfortunately, there is not yet enough evidence for the Task Force to recommend for or against additional screening with breast ultrasound or MRI. We are urgently calling for more research on whether and how additional screening might help women with dense breasts find cancers earlier. It is important to note that all women, including those with dense breasts, should be screened starting at age 40. While we call for more research, these women should talk to their clinicians about their options for follow-up testing so that they can get the care that’s right for them. Is there specific guidance on breast cancer screening for Black women? Black women are 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer than White women and too often get aggressive cancers at young ages. Ensuring Black women start screening at 40 is an important first step, yet it is not enough to improve these inequities. It’s important that patients receive equitable and appropriate follow-up after screening and effective treatment of breast cancer. We are urgently calling for more evidence to better understand whether Black women could potentially be helped by different screening strategies. View All Questions",

Grade: B Women 75 years or older: The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. Grade: I statement Women 75 years or older: The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. Grade: I statement To whom does this recommendation apply? These recommendations apply to cisgender women and all other persons assigned female at birth (including transgender men and nonbinary persons) 40 years or older at average risk of breast cancer. They also apply to women who have factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, such as a family history of breast cancer (ie, a first-degree relative with breast cancer) or having dense breasts. These recommendations do not apply to persons who have a genetic marker or syndrome associated with a high risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic variation), a history of high-dose radiation therapy to the chest at a young age, or previous breast cancer or a high-risk breast lesion on previous biopsies. What’s new? For the current recommendation, the USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 49 years, rather than individualizing the decision to undergo screening for women in this age group. This recommendation is otherwise consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for breast cancer. How to implement this recommendation? Screen women aged 40 to 74 with a mammogram every 2 years. Both digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (or “3D mammography”) are effective mammographic screening modalities. To achieve the benefit of screening and mitigate disparities in breast cancer mortality by race and ethnicity, it is important that all persons with abnormal screening mammography findings receive equitable and appropriate follow-up evaluation and additional testing, inclusive of indicated biopsies, and that all persons diagnosed with breast cancer receive effective treatment. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for breast cancer in women 75 years or older There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against supplemental screening using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women who have dense breasts. Clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for breast cancer in women 75 years or older and regarding whether to use supplemental screening in women who have dense breasts and an otherwise normal mammogram. What additional information should clinicians know about this recommendation? There are pronounced inequities in breast cancer stage at diagnosis, subtype, and mortality. Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer beyond stage 1, are more likely to be diagnosed with triple-negative cancers (ie, ER-, PR-, and HER2-), which are more aggressive tumors, and are approximately 40% more likely to die of breast cancer compared with White women. Why is this recommendation and topic important? Breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death among US women. In 2023, an estimated 43,170 women died of breast cancer. What are other relevant USPSTF recommendations? The USPSTF has issued recommendations on the use of medications to reduce women’s risk for breast cancer, as well as risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA1 - or BRCA2 -related cancer. What are additional tools and resources? The National Cancer Institute has information on breast cancer screening for health care professionals ( https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq ) and for patients ( https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/patient/breast-screening-pdq ).

The higher mortality rate for Black women diagnosed with breast cancer in the US aligns with other health inequities that are attributed to the effects of structural racism, which include inequalities in resources, harmful exposures, and access to and delivery of high-quality health care. 17-19 Racial and economic residential segregation driven by discriminatory housing policies has been associated with increased exposure to toxic environments such as air pollution, industrial waste, and built environments that do not support health, and stressful life conditions. Residential segregation has also been associated with both an increased risk of triple-negative breast cancer and poorer breast cancer–specific survival in Black women. 20-22",

The higher mortality rate for Black women diagnosed with breast cancer in the US aligns with other health inequities that are attributed to the effects of structural racism, which include inequalities in resources, harmful exposures, and access to and delivery of high-quality health care. 17-19 Racial and economic residential segregation driven by discriminatory housing policies has been associated with increased exposure to toxic environments such as air pollution, industrial waste, and built environments that do not support health, and stressful life conditions. Residential segregation has also been associated with both an increased risk of triple-negative breast cancer and poorer breast cancer–specific survival in Black women. 20-22",

The risk of a stage IIB or higher cancer diagnosis and of having a tumor with less favorable prognostic characteristics was higher for premenopausal women screened biennially vs annually (RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.01-1.63] and RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.00-1.22], respectively). However, this study did not conduct formal tests for interaction in the subgroup comparisons and did not adjust for multiple comparisons. One RCT (n = 76,022) conducted between 1989 and 1996 randomized individuals to annual or triennial screening and reported on breast cancer incidence. The number of screen-detected cancers was higher in the annual screening study group (RR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.28-2.09]). However, the total number of cancers diagnosed either clinically or with screening was similar after 3 years of screening. Cancers occurring in the annual screening group (including clinically diagnosed cancers) did not differ by prognostic features such as tumor size, node positivity status, or histologic grade compared with those in the triennial screening group. 55",

    "augmented_chunk": "Modeling of biennial mammography starting at 40 vs 50 — additional deaths averted, life‑years gained (greater for Black women)\n\nCollaborative modeling data estimated that compared with biennial screening from ages 50 to 74 years, biennial screening starting at age 40 years until 74 years would lead to 1.3 additional breast cancer deaths averted (median, 6.7 vs 8.2, respectively, across 6 models) per 1000 women screened over a lifetime of screening for all women ( Table 2 ; note that the 1.3 deaths averted is the median of the differences in each of 6 models, which is not the same as the difference of the medians noted above and in the table). Models also estimated that screening benefits for Black women are similar for breast cancer mortality reduction and greater for life-years gained and breast cancer deaths averted compared with all women. Thus, biennial screening starting at age 40 years would result in 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted (median, 9.2 deaths averted for screening from ages 50 to 74 vs 10.7 deaths averted, across 4 models) per 1000 women screened for Black women ( Table 2 ; note that the 1.8 deaths averted is the median of the differences in each of 4 models, which is not the same as the difference of the medians noted above and in the table). 12 Epidemiologic data has shown that the incidence rate of invasive breast cancer for 40- to 49-year-old women has increased an average of 2.0% annually between 2015 and 2019, a higher rate than in previous years. 3 These factors led the USPSTF to conclude that screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years has a moderate benefit by reducing the number of breast cancer deaths.",

Several comments suggested that there should be no upper age limit for breast cancer screening or that an upper age should be based on life expectancy. In response, the USPSTF notes that no trials of breast cancer screening enrolled women 75 years or older and an emulated trial showed no benefit to screening women aged 75 to 79 or 80 to 84. Some comments suggested that breast cancer screening should start prior to age 40 years, either for all women or for women who are at increased risk of breast cancer. Relatedly, some comments expressed that risk-based screening should be recommended. In response, the USPSTF would like to reiterate that no trials of breast cancer screening enrolled women younger than 39 years. Additionally, the USPSTF found no evidence on the benefits or harms of individualized breast cancer screening based on risk factors.

The USPSTF often needs additional evidence to create the strongest recommendations for everyone, especially those with the greatest burden of disease. In some cases, clinical preventive services have been well studied, but there are important evidence gaps that prevent the USPSTF from making recommendations for specific populations. In this table, the USPSTF summarizes the gaps in the evidence for screening for breast cancer and emphasizes health equity gaps that need to be addressed to advance the health of the nation. Although the health equity gaps focus on Black women because they have the poorest health outcomes from breast cancer, it is important to note that all studies should actively recruit enough women of all racial and ethnic groups, including Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander participants, to investigate whether the effectiveness of screening, diagnosis, and treatment vary by group. For additional information on research needed to address these evidence gaps, see the Research Gaps Taxonomy table on the USPSTF website ( https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/home/getfilebytoken/QTkyWhfQHqFUy4He2B6HU4 ). Screening for breast cancer Research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of screening for breast cancer in women age 75 years or older. Research is needed to help clinicians and patients understand the best strategy for breast cancer screening in women found to have dense breasts on a screening mammogram, which occurs in more than 40% of women screened. Research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of supplemental screening (eg, ultrasonography, MRI, or contrast-enhanced mammography) compared with usual care (DBT or digital mammography alone) for women with dense breasts. Studies are needed that report outcomes such as the rates of advanced breast cancers diagnosed across consecutive screening rounds in addition to the rates of diagnosis of breast cancer, and health outcomes such as quality of life and breast cancer–associated morbidity and mortality. Research is needed to understand and address the higher breast cancer mortality among Black women. Research is needed to understand why Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancers that have biomarker patterns that confer greater risk for poor health outcomes. Research is needed to understand how variations in care (including diagnosis and treatment) leads to increased risk of breast cancer morbidity and mortality in Black women, across the spectrum of stages and biomarker patterns, and on effective strategies to reduce this disparity. Research is needed to determine whether the benefits differ for annual vs biennial breast cancer screening among women overall and whether there is a different balance of benefits and harms among Black women compared with all women Research is needed to identify approaches to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis leading to overtreatment of breast lesions identified through screening that may not be destined to cause morbidity and mortality, including DCIS.

Research is needed to understand why Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancers that have biomarker patterns that confer greater risk for poor health outcomes.

    "raw_chunk": "Pain is classified based on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the duration, or the description of recognizable syndromes associated with pain.[ 7 ] The mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of pain are: Nociceptive. Neuropathic. Nociceptive pain, which may be either somatic or visceral in nature, originates with a chemical, mechanical, or thermal injury to tissue that stimulates pain receptors, which transmit a signal to the central nervous system (CNS), causing the perception of pain. Pain receptors are found in somatic (e.g., cutaneous, bone) and visceral tissues. The amount of visceral sensory innervation and the diffusion of visceral pain signals within the brain explain the difficulty experienced by patients in describing or localizing visceral pain compared with somatic pain. A specific type of visceral pain is referred pain, which is explained by the commingling of nerve fibers from somatic and visceral nociceptors at the level of the spinal cord. Patients mistakenly interpret the pain as originating from the innervated somatic tissue. Visceral pain may be accompanied by autonomic signs such as sweating, pallor, or bradycardia. Somatic pain is more easily localized. Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system or the CNS (spinal cord or brain). Causes of neuropathic pain of particular relevance to cancer include chemotherapy (e.g., vinca alkaloids), infiltration of the nerve roots by tumor, or damage to nerve roots (radiculopathy) or groups of nerve roots (plexopathy) due to tumor masses or treatment complications (e.g., radiation plexopathy).[ 8 ] The pain may be evoked by stimuli or spontaneous.

The extent of chemical coping strategies, including reliance on legal substances (e.g., nicotine, alcohol, and sleeping pills), may indicate a history of reliance on chemicals to alleviate distress. It can also provide the clinician with information about the patient’s nicotine use, which may affect how certain opioids may be differentially metabolized and the amount of opioids required to achieve pain control.[ 21 ] A remote history of substance use disorder can still affect current pain levels and analgesic requirements. Remote substance use may have long-term implications for pain sensitivity, even if the patient has a history of prolonged abstinence from opioid use.[ 22 ] Together, personal and family substance use can inform a risk assessment for potential abuse of medications, potential analgesic requirements, and diversion of prescriptions. Patients may experience pain and other symptoms at the same time during and after treatment. Symptoms that occur together over time may form a cluster. For more information, see Symptom Clusters in Cancer . Pain Prognostic Scores Several pain-related factors and patient-related factors predict response to pain treatment. Specifically, a high baseline pain intensity, neuropathic pain, and incident pain are often more difficult to manage.[ 23 ] Furthermore, several patient characteristics are associated with higher pain expression, higher opioid doses, and longer time to achieve pain control. These characteristics include a personal or family history of the following: Illicit drug use.[ 24 ] Alcohol use disorder.[ 24 , 25 ] Smoking.[ 26 - 28 ] Somatization.[ 29 ] Mental health issues such as depression or anxiety.[ 30 ] Cognitive dysfunction.[ 31 - 33 ]",

It can also provide the clinician with information about the patient’s nicotine use, which may affect how certain opioids may be differentially metabolized and the amount of opioids required to achieve pain control.[ 21 ] A remote history of substance use disorder can still affect current pain levels and analgesic requirements. Remote substance use may have long-term implications for pain sensitivity, even if the patient has a history of prolonged abstinence from opioid use.[ 22 ] Together, personal and family substance use can inform a risk assessment for potential abuse of medications, potential analgesic requirements, and diversion of prescriptions. Patients may experience pain and other symptoms at the same time during and after treatment. Symptoms that occur together over time may form a cluster. For more information, see Symptom Clusters in Cancer . Pain Prognostic Scores Several pain-related factors and patient-related factors predict response to pain treatment. Specifically, a high baseline pain intensity, neuropathic pain, and incident pain are often more difficult to manage.[ 23 ] Furthermore, several patient characteristics are associated with higher pain expression, higher opioid doses, and longer time to achieve pain control. These characteristics include a personal or family history of the following: Illicit drug use.[ 24 ] Alcohol use disorder.[ 24 , 25 ] Smoking.[ 26 - 28 ] Somatization.[ 29 ] Mental health issues such as depression or anxiety.[ 30 ] Cognitive dysfunction.[ 31 - 33 ]",

Men and women with OE may be offered hormone replacement therapy after a thorough risk-benefit discussion. Testosterone replacement is contraindicated in men with prostate cancer. Estrogen replacement therapy may be contraindicated in patients with breast and ovarian cancer and has serious associated health risks. Opioids have immunomodulatory effects through neuroendocrine mechanisms and by direct effects on opioid receptors on immune cells.[ 74 ] Opioids can alter the development, differentiation, and function of immune cells, causing immunosuppression.[ 43 ] Different opioids cause varying effects on the immune system. In mouse and rat models, methadone is less immunosuppressive than morphine. In contrast, tramadol improves natural killer cell activity. Further research is needed to determine the true clinical significance of opioid-induced immunosuppression, such as the risk of infections. The liver plays a major role in the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of opioids and most drugs. The liver produces enzymes involved in two forms of metabolism:[ 33 ] Phase 1 metabolism (modification reactions, CYP). Phase 2 metabolism (conjugation reactions, glucuronidation). Methadone and fentanyl are unaffected by liver disease and are drugs of choice in patients with hepatic failure.[ 75 , 76 ] Morphine, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone undergo glucuronidation exclusively. CYP2D6 metabolizes codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone; CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 metabolize methadone; and CYP3A4 metabolizes fentanyl.[ 33 ] Hepatic impairment affects both CYP enzymes and glucuronidation processes.

Opioids have immunomodulatory effects through neuroendocrine mechanisms and by direct effects on opioid receptors on immune cells.[ 74 ] Opioids can alter the development, differentiation, and function of immune cells, causing immunosuppression.[ 43 ] Different opioids cause varying effects on the immune system. In mouse and rat models, methadone is less immunosuppressive than morphine. In contrast, tramadol improves natural killer cell activity. Further research is needed to determine the true clinical significance of opioid-induced immunosuppression, such as the risk of infections. The liver plays a major role in the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of opioids and most drugs. The liver produces enzymes involved in two forms of metabolism:[ 33 ] Phase 1 metabolism (modification reactions, CYP). Phase 2 metabolism (conjugation reactions, glucuronidation). Methadone and fentanyl are unaffected by liver disease and are drugs of choice in patients with hepatic failure.[ 75 , 76 ] Morphine, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone undergo glucuronidation exclusively. CYP2D6 metabolizes codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone; CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 metabolize methadone; and CYP3A4 metabolizes fentanyl.[ 33 ] Hepatic impairment affects both CYP enzymes and glucuronidation processes. Prescribing information recommends caution when prescribing opioids for patients with hepatic impairment.",

Indicators chosen for \"potential misuse\" were 1) high daily opioid dose (≥100 MMEs daily), 2) multiple opioid prescription overlap of 7 or more days, 3) opioid and benzodiazepine overlap of 7 or more days, or 4) opioid dose escalation (≥50% increase in monthly average MME twice per year). Relative reduction in opioid prescription rates were 36.7% in survivors versus 15.9% in peers without cancer. Relative reduction in the rate of potential misuse and substance use disorder was 65.4% in survivors and 29.9% in peers without cancer.

These agents are not used if postoperative ileus or mechanical bowel obstruction is suspected.[ 69 , 70 ] Of note, several combination opioid and opioid-antagonist products (e.g., oxycodone-naltrexone) are FDA approved for pain management and have the added benefit of potentially preventing opioid-induced constipation.[ 71 ] Given the limited data about these agents in cancer patients and the high cost of these agents, further data are needed. Opioid endocrinopathy (OE) is the effect of opioids on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis over the long term. Opioids act on opioid receptors in the hypothalamus, decreasing the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone.[ 72 ] This results in a decreased release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, and finally a reduction of testosterone and estradiol released from the gonads. These effects occur in both men and women.[ 44 ] Patients may present with the following symptoms of hypogonadism: Decreased libido. Erectile dysfunction. Amenorrhea or irregular menses.

These drugs have been widely studied in the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes and as adjunctive agents with opioids. For more information, see the Approach to Neuropathic Pain section. These medications may cause the following symptoms:[ 10 , 116 ] Sedation. Dizziness. Peripheral edema. Nausea. Ataxia. Dry mouth. Gradual upward titration of gabapentin to a maximum of 3,600 mg per day and pregabalin to 300 mg per day can help with dose-dependent sedation and dizziness. In addition, starting doses of gabapentin may be given at bedtime to assist with tolerating any sedation. Doses of both agents need to be adjusted for patients with renal dysfunction.[ 10 , 116 ] The antidepressant medications venlafaxine and duloxetine have demonstrated some efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes. Venlafaxine and duloxetine are serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors originally approved for depression; however, both are used off-label for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). In addition, duloxetine is indicated for musculoskeletal pain. Both serotonin and norepinephrine have important roles in analgesia. Common dosing for duloxetine ranges from 30 to 60 mg per day. Side effects include the following:[ 117 ] Nausea. Headache. Fatigue. Dry mouth. Constipation. Duloxetine is avoided in patients with hepatic impairment and severe renal impairment, and it carries an increased risk of bleeding.

The immediate side effects of corticosteroid use include: Hyperglycemia. Insomnia. Immunosuppression. Psychiatric disorders. Serious long-term effects—myopathy, peptic ulceration, osteoporosis, and Cushing syndrome—encourage short-term use of corticosteroids. If taken for more than 3 weeks, corticosteroids are tapered upon improvement in pain, if possible. If corticosteroids are to be continued long term, anti-infective prophylaxis can be considered. Dexamethasone is preferred because it has reduced mineralocorticoid effects, resulting in reduced fluid retention; however, it does exhibit cytochrome P450–mediated drug interactions.",

The immediate side effects of corticosteroid use include: Hyperglycemia. Insomnia. Immunosuppression. Psychiatric disorders. Serious long-term effects—myopathy, peptic ulceration, osteoporosis, and Cushing syndrome—encourage short-term use of corticosteroids. If taken for more than 3 weeks, corticosteroids are tapered upon improvement in pain, if possible. If corticosteroids are to be continued long term, anti-infective prophylaxis can be considered. Dexamethasone is preferred because it has reduced mineralocorticoid effects, resulting in reduced fluid retention; however, it does exhibit cytochrome P450–mediated drug interactions.",

    "raw_chunk": "Not all internal organs have nociceptors. Typically, the hollow viscera (stomach, bowel, bladder, and ureters) are innervated and respond to mechanical-, inflammation-, and chemical-induced damage. For example, sensations originating from the liver or spleen are typically caused by distension of the capsule. There is a limited correlation between the degree of visceral injury and the intensity of the perceived pain.[ 7 ] The source of visceral pain is often difficult to localize. Referred pain may be perceived as remote from the actual affected organ (e.g., shoulder pain with splenic injury). In the phenomenon of sensitization, the normal activity of an organ is perceived as painful, such as stomach inflammation causing hyperawareness or hyperalgesia-related peristalsis of the stomach. Opioids remain the core treatment for severe or distressing visceral pain.[ 8 ] Also important are radiographic studies to look for underlying causes that may be amendable to other interventions (e.g., bowel obstruction). Approach to Neuropathic Pain Pain with features suggestive of neuropathic pain is common among patients with cancer and can have substantial negative consequences. One study of 1,051 patients with cancer found that 17% had neuropathic pain. These patients reported worse physical, cognitive, and social functioning than did those with nociceptive pain; were on more analgesic medications and higher doses of opioids; and had a worse performance status.[ 9 ] Neuropathic pain is considered less responsive to opioids. Multiple therapeutic options instead of or in addition to opioids have been studied. Most of these studies were conducted in patients with nonmalignant sources of neuropathic pain and may not be applicable to patients with cancer with different etiologies for their neuropathic pain.",

For example, sensations originating from the liver or spleen are typically caused by distension of the capsule. There is a limited correlation between the degree of visceral injury and the intensity of the perceived pain.[ 7 ] The source of visceral pain is often difficult to localize. Referred pain may be perceived as remote from the actual affected organ (e.g., shoulder pain with splenic injury). In the phenomenon of sensitization, the normal activity of an organ is perceived as painful, such as stomach inflammation causing hyperawareness or hyperalgesia-related peristalsis of the stomach. Opioids remain the core treatment for severe or distressing visceral pain.[ 8 ] Also important are radiographic studies to look for underlying causes that may be amendable to other interventions (e.g., bowel obstruction). Approach to Neuropathic Pain Pain with features suggestive of neuropathic pain is common among patients with cancer and can have substantial negative consequences. One study of 1,051 patients with cancer found that 17% had neuropathic pain. These patients reported worse physical, cognitive, and social functioning than did those with nociceptive pain; were on more analgesic medications and higher doses of opioids; and had a worse performance status.[ 9 ] Neuropathic pain is considered less responsive to opioids. Multiple therapeutic options instead of or in addition to opioids have been studied. Most of these studies were conducted in patients with nonmalignant sources of neuropathic pain and may not be applicable to patients with cancer with different etiologies for their neuropathic pain.",

    "raw_chunk": "Frequently Asked Questions What is the Task Force recommending? The Task Force recommends that all women get screened for breast cancer every other year, starting at age 40 and continuing through age 74, to reduce their risk of dying from this disease. This is a B grade . In this final recommendation statement, we are also urgently calling for more research that will allow us to build on our existing guidance and help all women live longer and healthier lives. Specifically, we need to know how best to address health disparities across screening and treatment experienced by Black, Hispanic, Latina, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, and Alaska Native women. We also need studies on what more should be done for women with dense breasts, and we need evidence on the benefits and harms of screening in older women. These are I statements . How is this different from your previous final recommendation? While we have consistently recognized the value of mammography, the latest science makes it clear that we can save even more lives from breast cancer. Previously, we recommended that women in their 40s make an individual decision with their clinician on when they should start screening, taking into account their health history, preferences, and how they value the different potential benefits and harms. The Task Force now recommends that all women start getting screened for breast cancer every other year starting at age 40. Basically, it’s a shift from recommending women start screening between the ages of 40 and 50 to recommending that all women start getting screened when they turn 40. Is there specific guidance for women with dense breasts? Nearly half of all women have dense breasts, which increases their risk for breast cancer and means that mammograms may not work as well for them. Women are generally told that they have dense breasts after they’ve had a mammogram. These women deserve to know whether and how additional screening might help them stay healthy. Unfortunately, there is not yet enough evidence for the Task Force to recommend for or against additional screening with breast ultrasound or MRI. We are urgently calling for more research on whether and how additional screening might help women with dense breasts find cancers earlier. It is important to note that all women, including those with dense breasts, should be screened starting at age 40. While we call for more research, these women should talk to their clinicians about their options for follow-up testing so that they can get the care that’s right for them. Is there specific guidance on breast cancer screening for Black women? Black women are 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer than White women and too often get aggressive cancers at young ages. Ensuring Black women start screening at 40 is an important first step, yet it is not enough to improve these inequities. It’s important that patients receive equitable and appropriate follow-up after screening and effective treatment of breast cancer. We are urgently calling for more evidence to better understand whether Black women could potentially be helped by different screening strategies. View All Questions",

Specifically, we need to know how best to address health disparities across screening and treatment experienced by Black, Hispanic, Latina, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, and Alaska Native women. We also need studies on what more should be done for women with dense breasts, and we need evidence on the benefits and harms of screening in older women. These are I statements . How is this different from your previous final recommendation? While we have consistently recognized the value of mammography, the latest science makes it clear that we can save even more lives from breast cancer. Previously, we recommended that women in their 40s make an individual decision with their clinician on when they should start screening, taking into account their health history, preferences, and how they value the different potential benefits and harms. The Task Force now recommends that all women start getting screened for breast cancer every other year starting at age 40. Basically, it’s a shift from recommending women start screening between the ages of 40 and 50 to recommending that all women start getting screened when they turn 40. Is there specific guidance for women with dense breasts? Nearly half of all women have dense breasts, which increases their risk for breast cancer and means that mammograms may not work as well for them. Women are generally told that they have dense breasts after they’ve had a mammogram. These women deserve to know whether and how additional screening might help them stay healthy. Unfortunately, there is not yet enough evidence for the Task Force to recommend for or against additional screening with breast ultrasound or MRI. We are urgently calling for more research on whether and how additional screening might help women with dense breasts find cancers earlier. It is important to note that all women, including those with dense breasts, should be screened starting at age 40. While we call for more research, these women should talk to their clinicians about their options for follow-up testing so that they can get the care that’s right for them. Is there specific guidance on breast cancer screening for Black women? Black women are 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer than White women and too often get aggressive cancers at young ages. Ensuring Black women start screening at 40 is an important first step, yet it is not enough to improve these inequities. It’s important that patients receive equitable and appropriate follow-up after screening and effective treatment of breast cancer. We are urgently calling for more evidence to better understand whether Black women could potentially be helped by different screening strategies. View All Questions",

Grade: B Women 75 years or older: The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. Grade: I statement Women 75 years or older: The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. Grade: I statement To whom does this recommendation apply? These recommendations apply to cisgender women and all other persons assigned female at birth (including transgender men and nonbinary persons) 40 years or older at average risk of breast cancer. They also apply to women who have factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, such as a family history of breast cancer (ie, a first-degree relative with breast cancer) or having dense breasts. These recommendations do not apply to persons who have a genetic marker or syndrome associated with a high risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic variation), a history of high-dose radiation therapy to the chest at a young age, or previous breast cancer or a high-risk breast lesion on previous biopsies. What’s new? For the current recommendation, the USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 49 years, rather than individualizing the decision to undergo screening for women in this age group. This recommendation is otherwise consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for breast cancer. How to implement this recommendation? Screen women aged 40 to 74 with a mammogram every 2 years. Both digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (or “3D mammography”) are effective mammographic screening modalities. To achieve the benefit of screening and mitigate disparities in breast cancer mortality by race and ethnicity, it is important that all persons with abnormal screening mammography findings receive equitable and appropriate follow-up evaluation and additional testing, inclusive of indicated biopsies, and that all persons diagnosed with breast cancer receive effective treatment. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for breast cancer in women 75 years or older There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against supplemental screening using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women who have dense breasts. Clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for breast cancer in women 75 years or older and regarding whether to use supplemental screening in women who have dense breasts and an otherwise normal mammogram. What additional information should clinicians know about this recommendation? There are pronounced inequities in breast cancer stage at diagnosis, subtype, and mortality. Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer beyond stage 1, are more likely to be diagnosed with triple-negative cancers (ie, ER-, PR-, and HER2-), which are more aggressive tumors, and are approximately 40% more likely to die of breast cancer compared with White women. Why is this recommendation and topic important? Breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death among US women. In 2023, an estimated 43,170 women died of breast cancer. What are other relevant USPSTF recommendations? The USPSTF has issued recommendations on the use of medications to reduce women’s risk for breast cancer, as well as risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA1 - or BRCA2 -related cancer. What are additional tools and resources? The National Cancer Institute has information on breast cancer screening for health care professionals ( https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq ) and for patients ( https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/patient/breast-screening-pdq ).

The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer with breast ultrasound or MRI, regardless of breast density. See Table 1 for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment. For more details on the methods the USPSTF uses to determine the net benefit, see the USPSTF Procedure Manual. 7 Patient Population Under Consideration",

It suggests that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually, that women 55 years or older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually, that women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years, and that women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer. 74 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer should be offered screening mammography starting at age 40 years, using shared decision-making, and if they have not initiated screening in their 40s, they should begin screening mammography by no later than age 50 years. It recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer should have screening mammography every 1 or 2 years and should continue screening mammography until at least age 75 years. Beyond age 75 years, the decision to discontinue screening mammography should be based on shared decision-making informed by the woman’s health status and longevity. 75 The American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging recommend annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years for women at average risk. They recommend that screening should continue past age 74 years, without an upper age limit, unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy. 76 The American College of Radiology also recommends breast cancer risk assessment by age 25 years for all individuals. 77 The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for breast cancer. 78",

However, previous studies mainly fine-tune LLMs on biomedical datasets with limited diversity, which often rely on benchmarks or narrow task scopes, significantly limiting the effectiveness of their medical instruction-following ability and generalizability. To bridge this gap, we propose creating a diverse, machine- generated medical IFT dataset, MedInstruct-52k , using GPT-4 and ChatGPT with a high-quality expert-curated seed set. We then fine-tune LLaMA-series models on the dataset to develop AlpaCare . Despite using a smaller domain-specific dataset than previous medical LLMs, AlpaCare not only demonstrates superior perfor- mance on medical applications, with up to 38.1% absolute gain over best baselines in medical free-form instruction evaluations, but also achieves 6.7% absolute gains averaged over multiple general domain benchmarks. Human evaluation further shows that AlpaCare consistently outperforms best baselines in terms of both correctness and helpfulness. We offer data, model, and code publicly available1. 1 I NTRODUCTION Recent advancements in the training of large language models (LLMs) have placed a significant emphasis on instruction-finetuning (IFT), a critical step in enabling pre-trained LLMs to effectively follow instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Longpre et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022). However, relying solely on NLP benchmarks to create instructional datasets can lead to ‘game-the-metric’ issues, often failing to meet actual user needs (Ouyang et al., 2022). To better align with human intent, Wang et al. (2023b) introduces the concept of fine-tuning LLMs using diverse machine-generated instruction-response pairs. Subsequent works further highlight the importance of diversity in IFT datasets (Taori et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023a; Chiang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). However, how to improve dataset diversity in the medical domain for aligning with various user inquiries is still underexplored. LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in the medical domain across various applications (Nori et al., 2023a;b; Singhal et al., 2022; 2023; Liévin et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). To alleviate privacy concerns and manage costs, several medical open-source LLMs (Han et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Wu et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b) have been developed by tuning LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) on medical datasets. Even substantial volumes, these datasets are limited in task scopes and instructions, primarily focusing on medical benchmarks or specific topics, due to the high cost of collecting real-world instruction datasets (Wang et al., 2023b), particularly when extending further into the medical domain(Jin et al., 2021; 2019).

To alleviate privacy concerns and manage costs, several medical open-source LLMs (Han et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Wu et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b) have been developed by tuning LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) on medical datasets. Even substantial volumes, these datasets are limited in task scopes and instructions, primarily focusing on medical benchmarks or specific topics, due to the high cost of collecting real-world instruction datasets (Wang et al., 2023b), particularly when extending further into the medical domain(Jin et al., 2021; 2019). This lack of diversity can negatively impact the models’ ability to follow instructions in medical applications and their effectiveness in the general ∗Corresponding Author: xinluzhang@ucsb.edu 1https://github.com/XZhang97666/AlpaCare 1arXiv:2310.14558v6 [cs.CL] 31 Mar 2025",

After generating tasks and conduct- ing deduplications, we employ ChatGPT to provide responses to the valid tasks. Conse- quently, we compile a 52k medical self-instruct dataset, MedInstruct-52k , which supervises the tuning on the LLaMA series models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; AI@Meta, 2024), resulting in AlpaCare . Due to the limited number of test sets available for evaluating medical LLMs in terms of instruction-following ability and medical ca- pacity, we introduce a new clinician-crafted free-form instruction evaluation test set, MedInstruct-test , covering medical tasks across different difficulty levels. Our comprehensive experiments within medical and general domains reveal that AlpaCare , solely tuned on the 52k diverse medical IFT dataset, exhibits enhanced performance on medical applications and strong generalizability. It achieves up to a 38.1% absolute gain over the best baselines in medical free-form instruction evaluations and a 6.7% absolute gain averaged over multiple general domain benchmarks. Moreover, our human study on free-form instruction evaluations shows that AlpaCare consistently produces better responses compared to existing medical LLMs by a large margin in terms of both correctness (+12%) and helpfulness (+49%).

The USPSTF often needs additional evidence to create the strongest recommendations for everyone, especially those with the greatest burden of disease. In some cases, clinical preventive services have been well studied, but there are important evidence gaps that prevent the USPSTF from making recommendations for specific populations. In this table, the USPSTF summarizes the gaps in the evidence for screening for breast cancer and emphasizes health equity gaps that need to be addressed to advance the health of the nation. Although the health equity gaps focus on Black women because they have the poorest health outcomes from breast cancer, it is important to note that all studies should actively recruit enough women of all racial and ethnic groups, including Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander participants, to investigate whether the effectiveness of screening, diagnosis, and treatment vary by group. For additional information on research needed to address these evidence gaps, see the Research Gaps Taxonomy table on the USPSTF website ( https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/home/getfilebytoken/QTkyWhfQHqFUy4He2B6HU4 ). Screening for breast cancer Research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of screening for breast cancer in women age 75 years or older. Research is needed to help clinicians and patients understand the best strategy for breast cancer screening in women found to have dense breasts on a screening mammogram, which occurs in more than 40% of women screened. Research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of supplemental screening (eg, ultrasonography, MRI, or contrast-enhanced mammography) compared with usual care (DBT or digital mammography alone) for women with dense breasts. Studies are needed that report outcomes such as the rates of advanced breast cancers diagnosed across consecutive screening rounds in addition to the rates of diagnosis of breast cancer, and health outcomes such as quality of life and breast cancer–associated morbidity and mortality. Research is needed to understand and address the higher breast cancer mortality among Black women. Research is needed to understand why Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancers that have biomarker patterns that confer greater risk for poor health outcomes. Research is needed to understand how variations in care (including diagnosis and treatment) leads to increased risk of breast cancer morbidity and mortality in Black women, across the spectrum of stages and biomarker patterns, and on effective strategies to reduce this disparity.

Peng et al. (2023) utilizes the same instructions with Alpaca but adopts GPT-4 as the \"teacher\" LLM to generate higher-quality and more diverse responses to improve the model’s alignment on 3H (Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness) (Askell et al., 2021). Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) is trained on the ShareGPT data (Sharegpt, 2023), which contains actual ChatGPT users’ diverse instructions, obtaining strong response quality and instruction-following ability. However, creating diverse IFT datasets for aligning models with various user intentions in the medical domain remains underexplored. LLMs in Biomedicine. Closed-source LLMs have demonstrated significant proficiency in the medical domain (OpenAI, 2022; 2023; Singhal et al., 2023; 2022). ChatGPT demonstrates promise in the US Medical Exam (Kung et al., 2023) and serves as a knowledge base for medical decision- making (Zhang et al., 2023). The MedPaLM (Singhal et al., 2022; 2023) have shown performance in answering medical questions on par with that of medical professionals. GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) obtains strong medical capacities without specialized training strategies in the medical domain or engineering for solving clinical tasks Nori et al. (2023a;b). Due to privacy concerns and high costs, several open-source medical LLMs (Xu et al., 2023b; Han et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Wu et al., 2023) have been built by tuning open-source base models on medical corpus. ChatDoctor (Li et al., 2023b) is fine-tuned using 100k online doctor-patient dialogues, while Baize-Healthcare (Xu et al., 2023b) employs about 100k Quora and MedQuAD dialogues. MedAlpaca (Han et al., 2023) utilizes a 230k dataset of question-answer pairs and dialogues. PMC-LLAMA (Wu et al., 2023) continually trains LLaMA with millions of medical textbooks and papers, and then tunes it with a 202M-token dataset formed by benchmarks and dialogues during IFT. However, due to the high cost of collecting diverse real-world user instructions (Wang et al., 2023b), their datasets are limited in diversity, mainly focusing on medical benchmarks or within certain topics, such as doctor-patient conversations, hampering models’ medical instruction-following ability and generalizability. We propose creating a cost-effective, diverse medical machine-generated IFT dataset using GPT-4 and ChatGPT to better align the model with various medical user intents. Other follow-up works after ours (Xie et al., 2024; Tran et al., 2023) consistently show the benefits of tuning medical LLMs with diverse machine-generated datasets. 3 M ETHOD Collecting a large-scale medical IFT dataset is challenging because it necessitates 1) a deep under- standing of the specific domain knowledge and 2) creativity in designing novel and diverse tasks by considering different real-world medical needs. To mitigate human effort while maintaining high quality, we propose a pipeline by instructing GPT-4 and ChatGPT to create a machine-generated dataset containing diverse domain-specific tasks. The process starts with utilizing a small set of high-quality clinician-curated seed tasks with 167 instances to prompt GPT-4 in generating medical tasks. Similar instructions are removed from the generated medical tasks, preserving 52k instances 3",

Instruction tuning: The dataset is used to fine-tune LLaMA models, developing AlpaCare . et al., 2023) creates a 52k diverse machine-generated IFT dataset by distilling knowledge from the \"teacher\" Text-Davinci-003 (Hinton et al., 2015; Li et al., 2022). Peng et al. (2023) utilizes the same instructions with Alpaca but adopts GPT-4 as the \"teacher\" LLM to generate higher-quality and more diverse responses to improve the model’s alignment on 3H (Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness) (Askell et al., 2021). Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) is trained on the ShareGPT data (Sharegpt, 2023), which contains actual ChatGPT users’ diverse instructions, obtaining strong response quality and instruction-following ability. However, creating diverse IFT datasets for aligning models with various user intentions in the medical domain remains underexplored. LLMs in Biomedicine. Closed-source LLMs have demonstrated significant proficiency in the medical domain (OpenAI, 2022; 2023; Singhal et al., 2023; 2022). ChatGPT demonstrates promise in the US Medical Exam (Kung et al., 2023) and serves as a knowledge base for medical decision- making (Zhang et al., 2023). The MedPaLM (Singhal et al., 2022; 2023) have shown performance in answering medical questions on par with that of medical professionals. GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) obtains strong medical capacities without specialized training strategies in the medical domain or engineering for solving clinical tasks Nori et al. (2023a;b). Due to privacy concerns and high costs, several open-source medical LLMs (Xu et al., 2023b; Han et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Wu et al., 2023) have been built by tuning open-source base models on medical corpus. ChatDoctor (Li et al., 2023b) is fine-tuned using 100k online doctor-patient dialogues, while Baize-Healthcare (Xu et al., 2023b) employs about 100k Quora and MedQuAD dialogues. MedAlpaca (Han et al., 2023) utilizes a 230k dataset of question-answer pairs and dialogues. PMC-LLAMA (Wu et al., 2023) continually trains LLaMA with millions of medical textbooks and papers, and then tunes it with a 202M-token dataset formed by benchmarks and dialogues during IFT. However, due to the high cost of collecting diverse real-world user instructions (Wang et al., 2023b), their datasets are limited in diversity, mainly focusing on medical benchmarks or within certain topics, such as doctor-patient conversations, hampering models’ medical instruction-following ability and generalizability. We propose creating a cost-effective, diverse medical machine-generated IFT dataset using GPT-4 and ChatGPT to better align the model with various medical user intents. Other follow-up works after ours (Xie et al., 2024; Tran et al., 2023) consistently show the benefits of tuning medical LLMs with diverse machine-generated datasets. 3 M ETHOD Collecting a large-scale medical IFT dataset is challenging because it necessitates 1) a deep under- standing of the specific domain knowledge and 2) creativity in designing novel and diverse tasks by considering different real-world medical needs. To mitigate human effort while maintaining high quality, we propose a pipeline by instructing GPT-4 and ChatGPT to create a machine-generated dataset containing diverse domain-specific tasks. The process starts with utilizing a small set of high-quality clinician-curated seed tasks with 167 instances to prompt GPT-4 in generating medical tasks. Similar instructions are removed from the generated medical tasks, preserving 52k instances 3",

The instruction-response pairs dataset, MedInstruct-52k , is used to tune the LLaMA, resulting in AlpaCare with superior medical instruction-following ability and generalizability. The pipeline is shown in Figure 2. CLINICIAN -CURATED SEED DATASET A diverse and high-quality seed task is essential for prompting LLMs in task generation (Wang et al., 2023b). We focus on 4 key areas, taking into account various user intents in medical applications, to improve the diversity of seed instructions: topic ,view,type, and difficulty level . Specifically, the topic covers various submedical domains, such as radiology, genetics, and psychophysiology. The view is derived from diverse medical personnel, including researchers, medical students, and patients, who have different inquiries, to ensure a comprehensive range of viewpoints based on various levels of domain knowledge. For the type, we include various task formats, such as summarization, rewriting, single-hop, and multi-hop reasoning, to align with different application needs. Lastly, each task is categorized by its medical difficulty level , ranging from 1 to 5 (low to high), to ensure that the seed tasks can prompt new tasks on a wide range of expertise levels. We defer the explanation of the difficulty score to Appendix B for further clarification. A clinician crafts each task considering these 4 dimensions, and each task contains instruction and may have a corresponding input, which could be a detailed medical example to further elucidate the instruction and enhance task diversity. Examples are shown in Figure 1. MEDICAL IFT D ATASET GENERATION AND LLM T UNING We utilize GPT-4 for in-context learning by randomly selecting 3 tasks from the seed set and generating 12 tasks for each run. To ensure generated task diversity, we instruct GPT-4 to consider the 4 aspects outlined in 3. To further amplify textual diversity, instructions with a Rouge-L similarity above 0.7 to any other generated task are discarded (Wang et al., 2023b). Due to the lengthy propriety of medical text, we separately generate responses for each task using ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo), which has demonstrated efficacy in the medical domain (Zhang et al., 2023).

Performance comparison of AlpaCare and instruction-tuned baselines. GPT-3.5-turbo acts as a judge for pairwise auto-evaluation.

The instruction-response pairs dataset, MedInstruct-52k , is used to tune the LLaMA, resulting in AlpaCare with superior medical instruction-following ability and generalizability. The pipeline is shown in Figure 2. CLINICIAN -CURATED SEED DATASET A diverse and high-quality seed task is essential for prompting LLMs in task generation (Wang et al., 2023b). We focus on 4 key areas, taking into account various user intents in medical applications, to improve the diversity of seed instructions: topic ,view,type, and difficulty level . Specifically, the topic covers various submedical domains, such as radiology, genetics, and psychophysiology. The view is derived from diverse medical personnel, including researchers, medical students, and patients, who have different inquiries, to ensure a comprehensive range of viewpoints based on various levels of domain knowledge. For the type, we include various task formats, such as summarization, rewriting, single-hop, and multi-hop reasoning, to align with different application needs. Lastly, each task is categorized by its medical difficulty level , ranging from 1 to 5 (low to high), to ensure that the seed tasks can prompt new tasks on a wide range of expertise levels. We defer the explanation of the difficulty score to Appendix B for further clarification. A clinician crafts each task considering these 4 dimensions, and each task contains instruction and may have a corresponding input, which could be a detailed medical example to further elucidate the instruction and enhance task diversity. Examples are shown in Figure 1. MEDICAL IFT D ATASET GENERATION AND LLM T UNING We utilize GPT-4 for in-context learning by randomly selecting 3 tasks from the seed set and generating 12 tasks for each run. To ensure generated task diversity, we instruct GPT-4 to consider the 4 aspects outlined in 3. To further amplify textual diversity, instructions with a Rouge-L similarity above 0.7 to any other generated task are discarded (Wang et al., 2023b). Due to the lengthy propriety of medical text, we separately generate responses for each task using ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo), which has demonstrated efficacy in the medical domain (Zhang et al., 2023). Finally, we result in 52k machine-generated medical instruction-response pairs, MedInstruct-52k . Detailed prompts for instruction and output generation are provided in the Appendix C. To verify medInstcut-52k ’s data quality, we randomly select 50 instances for a clinician to evaluate, resulting in 49 out of 50 responses being graded as correct, which demonstrates the dataset’s high quality.

    "raw_chunk": "Published at ICLR 2025 Open Science for Foundation Models (SCI-FM) Workshop LIMITATIONS Our approach utilizes ‘teacher’ LLMs, such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT, to automatically generate medical instruction-response pair datasets, employing these teacher models as medical knowledge bases. However, this could result in hallucinations in the medical knowledge generation. To enhance the generation reliability, we aim to integrate LLMs with the internet and knowledge graphs in future work. ETHICS STATEMENT This research demonstrates the potential of enhancing open-source LMs’ medical capacity and general applicability by distilling knowledge from more powerful \"teacher\" LLMs. We improve the smaller models’ ability to follow medical instructions and align with user intentions, offering potential benefits for future healthcare applications. Even though our model AlpaCare maintains comparable truthfulness scores compared to other baselines, but the rate of correct answers is still low, showing that our model is likely to hallucinate incorrect answers. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize that this system is designed to serve as an assistant tool, complementing but not replacing the expertise and judgment of healthcare professionals. All outputs generated by this system must be rigorously validated by licensed medical practitioners before any practical application. The transition of these LMs to practical medical scenarios — useful for healthcare professionals, patients, and other medical personnel — necessitates extensive research to ensure safety, privacy, and reliability. This development involves not only technical robustness but also a commitment to ethical standards. It includes comprehensive quality assessments in various clinical environments to ensure that the system meets the highest standards of accuracy and ethical conduct. Additionally, attention must be paid to the potential implications for patient privacy and data security, ensuring that all patient information is handled with the utmost confidentiality and in compliance with relevant data protection laws and healthcare regulations.

B M EDICAL TASK DIFFICULTY LEVEL SCORING SYSTEM We introduce a clinician-crafted seed set to generate MedInstruct-52k and a free-form medical instruction evaluation set, MedInstruct-test . This set spans a medical difficulty scale ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 represents the easiest tasks and 5 indicates the most challenging ones. A clinician assessed the difficulty levels of all instances within both the seed set and MedInstruct-test based on the scoring system shown in Table 8 This system offers a refined dimension for prompting GPT-4 to produce tasks across varied difficulty levels and to evaluate medical proficiency of instruction-tuned models. 14",

    "augmented_chunk": "Medical instruction dataset generation; teacher LLM hallucination risk; clinician-rated difficulty\n\nPublished at ICLR 2025 Open Science for Foundation Models (SCI-FM) Workshop LIMITATIONS Our approach utilizes ‘teacher’ LLMs, such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT, to automatically generate medical instruction-response pair datasets, employing these teacher models as medical knowledge bases. However, this could result in hallucinations in the medical knowledge generation. To enhance the generation reliability, we aim to integrate LLMs with the internet and knowledge graphs in future work. ETHICS STATEMENT This research demonstrates the potential of enhancing open-source LMs’ medical capacity and general applicability by distilling knowledge from more powerful \"teacher\" LLMs. We improve the smaller models’ ability to follow medical instructions and align with user intentions, offering potential benefits for future healthcare applications. Even though our model AlpaCare maintains comparable truthfulness scores compared to other baselines, but the rate of correct answers is still low, showing that our model is likely to hallucinate incorrect answers. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize that this system is designed to serve as an assistant tool, complementing but not replacing the expertise and judgment of healthcare professionals. All outputs generated by this system must be rigorously validated by licensed medical practitioners before any practical application. The transition of these LMs to practical medical scenarios — useful for healthcare professionals, patients, and other medical personnel — necessitates extensive research to ensure safety, privacy, and reliability. This development involves not only technical robustness but also a commitment to ethical standards. It includes comprehensive quality assessments in various clinical environments to ensure that the system meets the highest standards of accuracy and ethical conduct. Additionally, attention must be paid to the potential implications for patient privacy and data security, ensuring that all patient information is handled with the utmost confidentiality and in compliance with relevant data protection laws and healthcare regulations.

The evaluation results for 4 reference models on both datasets are summarized in Table 1. AlpaCare outperforms its general domain counterpart, Alpaca, demonstrating that domain-specific training bolsters medical capabilities. Despite tuning with only 52k medical instruction-response pairs, AlpaCare consistently and significantly surpasses other medical models, which are trained on considerably larger datasets, across various reference LLMs. Specifically, for average scores across reference models, AlpaCare demonstrates a relative gain of 130% on iCliniq and 90% on MedInstruct, respectively, compared to the best baselines. These results highlight the advantages of improving medical proficiency by training with a diverse, domain-specific IFT dataset. Surprisingly, medical LLMs don’t always outperform general ones in medical tasks, and some even fail to generate useful responses, possibly due to their limited training scope restricting conversational skills. Benchmark Evaluation Performance. Table 2 presents an extensive evaluation of AlpaCare on 5 medical benchmarks. AlpaCare obtain the best performance on average, highlighting its robust capability in the medical domain. Benchmarks evaluate a model’s intrinsic knowledge(Gao et al., 2021), which is mainly gained in LLM pretraining instead of instruction fine-tuning (Zhou et al., 2023). AlpaCare ’s strong medical capability, combined with its superior ability to follow medical instructions, enables it to meet a wide range of medical application needs effectively. GENERALIZABILITY EVALUATION Training models with specific data may lead to catastrophic forgetting, limiting their generalizability (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017). Our approach, instruction tuning a model with a diverse, domain-specific dataset, aims to improve its generalizability simultaneously. We test this using AlpaCare in AlpaFarm (Dubois et al., 2023), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022) and TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022). We compare AlpaCare with 4 reference LLMs in AlpaFarm and report the average score, and follow Chia et al. (2023) to holistically evaluate models’ general domain knowledge on MMLU (5-shot) and BBH (3-shot), receptively; and evaluate the model truthfulness on TruthfulQA (0-shot) with Gao et al. (2021). The results are shown in Table 3. The detailed score for each reference model on AlpaFarm and more general domain experiment are deferred to Table 13 and Table 14 in the Appendix G. Medical LLMs often have worse or comparable results than the general LLM, Alpaca, in terms of generalizability. However, AlpaCare significantly outperforms both medical and general domain baselines in multiple general tasks on average. Specifically, AlpaCare shows a significant relative improvement of 57.8% on AlpacaFarm compared to the best baseline, demonstrating strong general instruction-following ability. Moreover, AlpaCare scores higher in general knowledge tasks and main- tains comparable truthfulness scores compared to other baselines, indicating strong generalization abilities due to high data diversity. ABLATION STUDY To further understand the effectiveness of AlpaCare , we conduct systematic ablation studies on two medical free-form instruction evaluations and report mean results of each task across 4 reference models, receptively. We defer detailed results of each reference model into Appendix G. 6",

The evaluation results for 4 reference models on both datasets are summarized in Table 1. AlpaCare outperforms its general domain counterpart, Alpaca, demonstrating that domain-specific training bolsters medical capabilities. Despite tuning with only 52k medical instruction-response pairs, AlpaCare consistently and significantly surpasses other medical models, which are trained on considerably larger datasets, across various reference LLMs. Specifically, for average scores across reference models, AlpaCare demonstrates a relative gain of 130% on iCliniq and 90% on MedInstruct, respectively, compared to the best baselines. These results highlight the advantages of improving medical proficiency by training with a diverse, domain-specific IFT dataset. Surprisingly, medical LLMs don’t always outperform general ones in medical tasks, and some even fail to generate useful responses, possibly due to their limited training scope restricting conversational skills. Benchmark Evaluation Performance. Table 2 presents an extensive evaluation of AlpaCare on 5 medical benchmarks. AlpaCare obtain the best performance on average, highlighting its robust capability in the medical domain. Benchmarks evaluate a model’s intrinsic knowledge(Gao et al., 2021), which is mainly gained in LLM pretraining instead of instruction fine-tuning (Zhou et al., 2023). AlpaCare ’s strong medical capability, combined with its superior ability to follow medical instructions, enables it to meet a wide range of medical application needs effectively. GENERALIZABILITY EVALUATION Training models with specific data may lead to catastrophic forgetting, limiting their generalizability (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017). Our approach, instruction tuning a model with a diverse, domain-specific dataset, aims to improve its generalizability simultaneously. We test this using AlpaCare in AlpaFarm (Dubois et al., 2023), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022) and TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022). We compare AlpaCare with 4 reference LLMs in AlpaFarm and report the average score, and follow Chia et al. (2023) to holistically evaluate models’ general domain knowledge on MMLU (5-shot) and BBH (3-shot), receptively; and evaluate the model truthfulness on TruthfulQA (0-shot) with Gao et al. (2021). The results are shown in Table 3. The detailed score for each reference model on AlpaFarm and more general domain experiment are deferred to Table 13 and Table 14 in the Appendix G. Medical LLMs often have worse or comparable results than the general LLM, Alpaca, in terms of generalizability. However, AlpaCare significantly outperforms both medical and general domain baselines in multiple general tasks on average. Specifically, AlpaCare shows a significant relative improvement of 57.8% on AlpacaFarm compared to the best baseline, demonstrating strong general instruction-following ability. Moreover, AlpaCare scores higher in general knowledge tasks and main- tains comparable truthfulness scores compared to other baselines, indicating strong generalization abilities due to high data diversity. ABLATION STUDY To further understand the effectiveness of AlpaCare , we conduct systematic ablation studies on two medical free-form instruction evaluations and report mean results of each task across 4 reference models, receptively. We defer detailed results of each reference model into Appendix G. 6",

To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in a user-oriented manner, we conduct free-form instruction evaluations on two medical datasets. (1) iCliniq2, a dataset comprising transcripts of real patient-doctor conversations collected from an online website (Li et al., 2023b). In this task, the model processes patient inquiries as input and then simulates a doctor to provide corresponding answers. (2) MedInstruct-test , a dataset created by our clinicians, includes 216 medical instructions. These instructions mimic inquiries posed by different medical personnel, varying in difficulty on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the simplest and 5 being the most challenging. We defer the difficulty levels description and test set statistics into the Appendix B and F, respectively. Evaluation Metric. We conduct auto-evaluation by employing GPT-3.5-turbo to serve as a judge (Zheng et al., 2023). The judge pairwise compares responses from a model with reference responses produced by another LLM API for each instruction in the test sets. To conduct a holistic evaluation, we employ reference outputs generated by 4 different APIs: Text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4 and Claude-2, respectively. To ensure unbiased evaluation and avoid positional bias (Wang et al., 2023a), we evaluate each output comparison twice, alternating the order of the model output and the reference output. We follow Li et al. (2023a) to score our models and baselines by calculating the win rate. To ensure fair comparisons, we set the maximum token length to 1024 and utilize greedy decoding for the generation of all model outputs and reference responses. BENCHMARK EVALUATION Datasets. We further evaluate AlpaCare on 4 medical multiple-choice benchmarks, namely MedQA (Jin et al., 2021), HeadQA (Vilares & Gómez-Rodríguez, 2019), PubmedQA (Jin et al., 2019), and MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), as well as a summarization dataset, i.e., MeQSum (Ben Abacha & Demner-Fushman, 2019)3, to assess the model’s medical capacity. Evaluation Metric. Following Gao et al. (2021), we conduct the multiple-choice benchmark evaluation and report the accuracy. For the summarization task, we utilize greedy decoding with a maximum token length of 1024 to generate outputs and report the ROUGE-L score. BASELINES We evaluate the performance of AlpaCare by comparing it with both general and medical LLMs based on the LLaMA models. We consider a range of models including: (1) Alpaca, tuning on 52k general domain machine-generated samples with responses from Text-davinci-003; (2) ChatDoctor, fine- tuning with 100k real patient-doctor dialogues; (3) MedAlpaca, utilizing approximately 230k medical instances such as Q&A pairs and doctor-patient conversations; (4) PMC-LLaMA (PMC), a two-step tuning model that was first trained on 4.8 million biomedical papers and 30k medical textbooks, then instruction-tuned on a corpus of 202 million tokens; and (5) Baize-Healthcare (Baize-H), training with around 100k multi-turn medical dialogues. 2We randomly selected 1,000 instances for evaluation from the 10,000 instances proposed by Li et al. (2023b). 3We randomly selected 200 out of 1000 instances in MeQSum. 5",

The cost of using the GPT-4 API is 30 times higher than that of GPT-3.5-Turbo at the time we created the dataset, which would increase the response cost to $15,000, making it difficult to stay within budget. Therefore, we utilized GPT-3.5-Turbo as the response generator and one of our evaluators to balance cost and effectiveness. To demonstrate the suitability of using GPT-3.5-Turbo for dataset generation, we verified the quality of MedInstruct-52k by randomly selecting 50 instances and having a clinician evaluate the responses generated by GPT-3.5-Turbo. The clinician found 49 out of 50 responses to be correct, demonstrating the dataset’s high quality. E T RAINING HYPERPARAMETER DETAILS Here we provide hyperparameter details for AlpaCare training.
